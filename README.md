**CMakeLists.txt**: This file tells the build system where to find the other application files, and links the application directory with Zephyr’s CMake build system. This link provides features supported by Zephyr’s build system, such as board-specific configuration files, the ability to run and debug compiled binaries on real or emulated hardware, and more.

**app.overlay**: This is a devicetree overlay file that specifies application-specific changes which should be applied to the base devicetree for any board you build for. The purpose of devicetree overlays is usually to configure something about the hardware used by the application.

The build system looks for app.overlay by default, but you can add more devicetree overlays, and other default files are also searched for.

See Devicetree for more information about devicetree.

**prj.conf**: This is a Kconfig fragment that specifies application-specific values for one or more Kconfig options. These application settings are merged with other settings to produce the final configuration. The purpose of Kconfig fragments is usually to configure the software features used by the application.

The build system looks for prj.conf by default, but you can add more Kconfig fragments, and other default files are also searched for.

See Kconfig Configuration below for more information.

**VERSION**: A text file that contains several version information fields. These fields let you manage the lifecycle of the application and automate providing the application version when signing application images.

See Application version management for more information about this file and how to use it.

**src/main.c**: A source code file. Applications typically contain source files written in C, C++, or assembly language. The Zephyr convention is to place them in a subdirectory of <app> named src.
